Q2)Explain client-side scripting language. Give examples.
- Client-side scripting is used to generate code that runs on the client side or in a web browser.
- Therefore, no server-side processing is required.
- Typically, the client-side script is inside an HTML document.
- Client-side scripting can reduce server load.
- When a user requests a specific web page through the browser, the server sends an HTML file that the browser can interpret and render the content on the client side.

- The examples of Client-side languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to build the structure of a web page.
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and is a design language used to add style to web pages.
- JavaScript is used to add user interaction and make web pages more dynamic.
Thank you.
